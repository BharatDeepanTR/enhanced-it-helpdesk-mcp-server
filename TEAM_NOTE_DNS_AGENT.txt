**DNS Agent Core Runtime Update:**

Successfully diagnosed the startup failure for Agent Core Runtime `a208194_chatops_route_dns_lookup`. The agent shows "Ready" status but fails during invocation due to missing SSM parameters at the expected path. We've fixed IAM permissions and identified that the container expects configuration parameters at `/app/` but they exist at `/a208194/APISECRETS/`. Admin team needs to execute a simple 3-parameter copy operation (detailed in attached `DNS_AGENT_SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`) to complete the fix. Once resolved, the DNS agent will be fully functional and ready for integration with Supervisor Agent and Central Orchestrator. Estimated fix time: 5 minutes. Expected integration timeline: Same day completion possible.

**Request for Team Review:**
- Please validate our diagnosis and proposed solution approach
- Confirm if the admin SSM parameter copy approach is acceptable, or if you prefer rebuilding the container with correct paths
- Any concerns about the integration timeline or dependencies?
- Additional validation steps you'd recommend post-fix?
- Input on production deployment strategy for Supervisor Agent integration?
